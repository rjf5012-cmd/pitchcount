    <p class="muted">
      This page provides a general overview of common pitching rules used in Little League–style formats.
      It is not an official rulebook. Each league and division can adopt its own specific rules, so always
      review your local league&rsquo;s current regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical Structure of Little League–Style Pitching Rules</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li>Pitch count limits by league age (for example, different caps for 9–10 vs. 11–12).</li>
      <li>Required rest days based on the number of pitches thrown in a day.</li>
      <li>Restrictions on pitching and catching in the same game.</li>
      <li>Eligibility rules for tournament play (e.g., days of rest before pitching again).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      To see example pitch limits and rest rules summarized in one place, visit the
      <a href="/youth-pitch-count-guide.html">Youth Pitch Count Rules Explained (2025 Guide)</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pitch Counts Matter</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The core goal of these rules is to protect young pitchers from overuse injuries.
      Pitch count rules help coaches and parents avoid the temptation to leave a pitcher
      in too long during close games or tournaments. The
      <a href="/protecting-young-pitchers-arm.html">Pitcher Safety guide</a> explains this in more detail.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Calculator with Little League–Style Rules</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The <a href="/">Pitch Count Calculator</a> on this site is designed to align with common Little League–style limits:
      you select a league age, enter pitches thrown, and get a recommended number of rest days along with the next eligible
      pitching date.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      If your league uses slightly different numbers, you can still use the calculator as a quick reference while applying
      your local thresholds when determining whether a player is eligible to pitch.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to Find Official Rules</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      For official rules, you should always refer to:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li>Your league&rsquo;s printed or online rulebook</li>
      <li>Communications from your league board or president</li>
      <li>Any tournament-specific pitching regulations provided to coaches</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      This site is meant to complement those resources by giving you fast, game-ready tools and simplified explanations
      you can use in real time.
    </p>
