  <h1>About PitchCountCalculator.com</h1>
  <p style="color:#777;font-size:0.85rem;">Last updated: December 2025</p>

  <p>
    PitchCountCalculator.com was created to give youth baseball coaches and parents a simple, reliable way to
    manage pitch counts and rest days. Instead of guessing during games or flipping through rulebooks, this site
    provides a clean calculator and clear explanations so you can focus on the kids on the field.
  </p>

  <p>
    The calculator on the home page is designed for real-world use in the dugout. You can tap to track each pitch,
    enter a player’s league age, and instantly see how many pitches they are allowed that day and when they’ll be
    eligible to pitch again. The logic is based on common youth baseball guidelines, similar to Little League and
    other national organizations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the calculator, PitchCountCalculator.com includes longer guides that explain how pitch count rules work,
    how many pitches kids should throw at different ages, and how to protect young pitchers’ arms over the course of
    a season. These articles are written to be practical and easy to understand, with the goal of helping volunteers,
    new coaches, and experienced baseball families make informed decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site does not replace your league’s official rules or medical advice. Every league can adopt its own pitch
    count policies, and every player is different. Always follow your local rulebook and listen to players when they
    tell you how their arm feels. Use this site as a supporting resource and quick reference, not a substitute for
    common sense or safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have suggestions, feedback, or ideas for new features and tools, please reach out through the
    <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>. The goal is to keep improving this resource for the coaches, parents,
    and players who rely on it.
