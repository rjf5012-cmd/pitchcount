    <h1>About PitchCountCalculator.com</h1>

    <p>
      PitchCountCalculator.com is a simple tool built for youth baseball coaches, parents, and league volunteers
      who want a quick way to manage pitch counts and rest days. Instead of flipping through rulebooks or charts,
      you can get an instant snapshot of how many pitches a player has thrown and when they can safely pitch again.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
    <p>
      Many youth coaches juggle lineups, substitutions, and pitch counts while trying to keep games fun and safe.
      This site makes pitch count tracking easier, especially on a phone during live games, so you can focus more
      on coaching and less on math.
    </p>

    <h2>What this site is (and isn&rsquo;t)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is:</strong> A quick reference and calculator for pitch counts and rest days.</li>
      <li><strong>Is not:</strong> Official league policy or medical advice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Always follow your local league&rsquo;s rules and listen to qualified medical professionals when it comes
      to player health and safety.
