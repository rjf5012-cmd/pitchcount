      This page provides a high-level overview of commonly used youth baseball pitch count rules.
      Exact limits can vary by league, tournament, or governing body, so always consult your official
      rulebook. For a deep dive, see the
      <a href="/youth-pitch-count-guide.html">2025 Pitch Count Rules Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>League Age</th>
        <th>Example Max Pitches/Game</th>
      </tr>

    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:12px;">
      These numbers represent maximums, not targets. Most pitchers do not need to reach the limit every time they pitch.
      The <a href="/">Pitch Count Calculator</a> uses similar limits when showing max pitches and remaining pitches.
    </p>

    <h2>Required Rest Based on Pitches Thrown</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Many leagues also require specific rest periods based on how many pitches a player throws in a single day.
      You can view example rest charts on the <a href="/rest-day-chart.html">Rest Day Chart</a> page.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Safety Rules for Youth Pitchers</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li>Pitchers should not throw when their arm is in pain or when they show obvious signs of fatigue.</li>
      <li>Players should not pitch and catch in the same game due to high throwing volume.</li>
      <li>Breaking balls are often discouraged for younger players, especially under age 13.</li>
      <li>Year-round pitching is generally discouraged; kids need months off from overhead throwing each year.</li>
      <li>Coaches and parents should monitor total workload across all teams, not just a single league.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using the Calculator with Your Local Rules</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The <a href="/">Pitch Count &amp; Rest Day Calculator</a> is designed around widely used, age-based limits.
      If your league uses slightly different thresholds, you can still use the tool as a guideline while deferring
      to your official rules whenever there is a conflict.
